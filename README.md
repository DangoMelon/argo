# ARGO Floats

This is by no means a library, it's just a collection of scripts I developed to process and do some nice plotting of ARGO data. Most of the ouput figures can be found on the Geophysical Institute of Peru (IGP) [ ARGO website](http://www.met.igp.gob.pe/variabclim/argo.html).

This work is a combination of python (mostly xarray and dask) for processing and GrADS for plotting.

Some sample output taken directly from the website

*This one was made in python*
